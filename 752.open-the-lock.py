#
# You have a lock in front of you with 4 circular wheels. Each wheel has 10
# slots: '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'. The wheels can
# rotate freely and wrap around: for example we can turn '9' to be '0', or '0'
# to be '9'. Each move consists of turning one wheel one slot.
#
# The lock initially starts at '0000', a string representing the state of the 4
# wheels.
#
# You are given a list of deadends dead ends, meaning if the lock displays any
# of these codes, the wheels of the lock will stop turning and you will be
# unable to open it.
#
# Given a target representing the value of the wheels that will unlock the
# lock, return the minimum total number of turns required to open the lock, or
# -1 if it is impossible.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: deadends = ["0201","0101","0102","1212","2002"], target = "0202"
# Output: 6
# Explanation:
# A sequence of valid moves would be "0000" -> "1000" -> "1100" -> "1200" ->
# "1201" -> "1202" -> "0202".
# Note that a sequence like "0000" -> "0001" -> "0002" -> "0102" -> "0202"
# would be invalid,
# because the wheels of the lock become stuck after the display becomes the
# dead end "0102".
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: deadends = ["8888"], target = "0009"
# Output: 1
# Explanation:
# We can turn the last wheel in reverse to move from "0000" -> "0009".
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: deadends = ["8887","8889","8878","8898","8788","8988","7888","9888"],
# target = "8888"
# Output: -1
# Explanation:
# We can't reach the target without getting stuck.
#
#
# Example 4:
#
#
# Input: deadends = ["0000"], target = "8888"
# Output: -1
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <=Â deadends.length <= 500
# deadends[i].length == 4
# target.length == 4
# target will not be in the list deadends.
# target and deadends[i] consist of digits only.
