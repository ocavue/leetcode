# Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the
# list is even, there is no middle value. So the median is the mean of the two
# middle value.
# For example,
#
# [2,3,4], the median is 3
#
# [2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5
#
# Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:
#
#
# void addNum(int num) - Add a integer number from the data stream to the data
# structure.
# double findMedian() - Return the median of all elements so far.
#
#
#
#
# Example:
#
#
# addNum(1)
# addNum(2)
# findMedian() -> 1.5
# addNum(3)
# findMedian() -> 2
#
#
#
#
# Follow up:
#
#
# If all integer numbers from the stream are between 0Â and 100, how would you
# optimize it?
# If 99% of all integer numbers from the stream are between 0 and 100, how
# would you optimize it?
