#
# You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each
# house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are
# arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last
# one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, andÂ it will
# automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on
# the same night.
#
# Given a list of non-negative integers nums representing the amount of money
# of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without
# alerting the police.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: nums = [2,3,2]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money =
# 2), because they are adjacent houses.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
# Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: nums = [0]
# Output: 0
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= nums.length <= 100
# 0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
#
