# Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.
#
# Note:
#
#
# Note that in some languages such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type.
# In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type.
# They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary
# representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
# In Java,Â the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement
# notation. Therefore, in Example 2Â above, the input represents the signed
# integer -3Â and the output represents the signed integer -1073741825.
#
#
# Follow up:
#
# If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: n = 00000010100101000001111010011100
# Output:    964176192 (00111001011110000010100101000000)
# Explanation: The input binary string 00000010100101000001111010011100
# represents the unsigned integer 43261596, so return 964176192 which its
# binary representation is 00111001011110000010100101000000.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
# Output:   3221225471 (10111111111111111111111111111111)
# Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101
# represents the unsigned integer 4294967293, so return 3221225471 which its
# binary representation is 10111111111111111111111111111111.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# The input must be a binary string of length 32
#
